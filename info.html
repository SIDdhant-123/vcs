<!-- Git -> is used for version control. (i.e. like in game we have savepoint and if we die we can continue from last savepoint),
            similarly  if our recent working code messes up we can go back to last working code OR if our system crashes we have our last 
            working code on cloud called GitHub

    STEPS TO INSTALL GIT: 
                1)Step1: Install Git from "https://git-scm.com/downloads"
                2) Check: on vs code press "ctrl+j" this will open terminal of VsCode & type "git --version" to check version

                "ctrl+l" to clear terminal of vscode

   #commands:
    1)git init: git comes into action and git is initialised in our folder and starts tracks of all our file. and all new files we would see (U) symbol which tell file is untracked

    NOTE: Git is Director at backstage & actors of natak are files -> so director knows actors are at backstage but their exact location  is not known to him is untracked

    2)git status: this will list down all the untracked files

    3) git add index.html: this will bring "index.html" actor infront of director at the backstage and he is ready to on stage to perform
    4) git commit -m 'my 1st version of code': commit is actually like savepoints in game and we will do it whenever do sucessfully done one functionality & we push that actor on stage
       and for the first time comitting you get error of "who you are?" and we can resolve it by configuring or email & username by commands
       git config --global user.email "you@example.com"   & check using "git config user.name" & "git config user.email"
       git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    5) git add .: to add all files in one go
    6) git log: to check logs of all the comitts we made till now. that list of savepoints we created till date   & Type q+Enter to exit logs     
    7) git reset --hard <code>: if you have made blunder in the latest code and you cannot find your error so you can go to previous comitt
                               --hard means dont want any of the recent code take me to previous mentioned commit
   8) git reset --soft <code>: here your code will not be deleted in which you are working that means you have to remove error yourself
                               but the commit you made will be deleted and in logs you wont see that commit. whereas in --hard
                               it use to delete our code to the last version of commit as well as the commit you made will be deleted and in logs you wont see that commit
   9)
